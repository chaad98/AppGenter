                not suitable for all investors. The Application is complex and speculative, and under no circumstances should you risk more than you are 
                prepared to lose. You should consider whether you understand how such trading and the Application works and whether you can afford 
                to take the high risk of losing of all of your invested financial funds. Seek independent advice if necessary. In case you do not 
                understand properly the principles of such trading and/or the principles of the Application and/or the high risk that is associated
